# Cursor Rules for OneView All Providers

## Git Commit Rules
- **NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to commit**
- **EXPLICIT PERMISSION REQUIRED**: Only commit when user says "commit changes", "commit", "save changes", or similar explicit command
- **DO NOT COMMIT** when user says "ok", "good", "thanks", "that works", or any other non-commit phrases
- **DO NOT COMMIT** after making changes - always wait for explicit commit instruction
- If you make changes, inform the user what was changed but don't commit automatically
- When user asks to commit, ask for confirmation if there are console logs present

## Accessibility and Testing Requirements
- **ALWAYS add semantic accessibility attributes to all new UI components and functionality:**
  - `data-testid` attributes for testing and DOM inspection
  - `role` attributes for screen readers and accessibility
  - `aria-*` attributes (aria-label, aria-labelledby, aria-checked, etc.) as appropriate
  - Use semantic HTML elements (nav, main, aside, header, footer, section, etc.) instead of generic divs when possible

## Code Quality Standards
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Add proper error handling
- Include helpful comments for complex logic
- Maintain consistent code formatting

## Project-Specific Guidelines
- This is a React/TypeScript application using Supabase as the backend
- Use React Query for data fetching
- Follow the existing component structure and naming conventions
- Grid tables must include provider_id column linking to providers table
- Use AG Grid API adjustments when possible instead of custom CSS modifications
