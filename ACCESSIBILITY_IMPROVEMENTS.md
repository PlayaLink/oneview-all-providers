## Key Accessibility Features Added

### Semantic HTML Elements
- `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`
- `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>` for proper heading hierarchy
- `<button>`, `<a>` for interactive elements
- `<label>` for form controls

### ARIA Roles and Attributes
- `role="banner"` for application header
- `role="navigation"` for navigation menus
- `role="main"` for main content area
- `role="complementary"` for sidebar
- `role="region"` for content sections
- `role="contentinfo"` for footer
- `role="tablist"` and `role="tab"` for tab navigation
- `role="grid"` for data tables
- `role="combobox"` for search functionality
- `role="dialog"` for modal dialogs
- `aria-label` for descriptive labels
- `aria-labelledby` for element relationships
- `aria-expanded` for expandable content
- `aria-controls` for element relationships
- `aria-current` for current page indication
- `aria-selected` for selected items
- `aria-hidden` for decorative elements

### Keyboard Navigation
- Added keyboard support for collapsible sections (Enter/Space)
- Proper focus management for interactive elements
- Tab order optimization

### Testing Support
- Added `data-testid` attributes throughout components
- Consistent naming conventions for test selectors
- Semantic test IDs that reflect component purpose

### Screen Reader Support
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3)
- Descriptive `aria-label` attributes
- Hidden labels for form controls
- Status announcements for dynamic content
- Proper element relationships with `aria-labelledby` and `aria-controls`

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Semantic HTML First**: Used appropriate HTML elements before adding ARIA attributes
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: ARIA attributes enhance rather than replace semantic HTML
3. **Testing Integration**: Added comprehensive `data-testid` attributes for automated testing
4. **Keyboard Accessibility**: Ensured all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
5. **Screen Reader Optimization**: Added proper labels, descriptions, and relationships
6. **Focus Management**: Maintained logical tab order and focus indicators

## Future Considerations

When creating new components, continue to:
1. Use semantic HTML elements (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, etc.)
2. Add appropriate ARIA roles and attributes
3. Include `data-testid` attributes for testing
4. Ensure keyboard navigation support
5. Provide proper labels and descriptions for screen readers
6. Test with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation
